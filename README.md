# Background
  Perovskite cells are hailed as the next generation of solar cells that are more efficient than traditional and widely used silicon cells.  One drawback to this is they tend to degrade at a much faster rate than the current silicon cells when under direct sunlight. 
  Dr. Fenning's lab employs an experimental method involving various samples of perovskite
film using different synthesis conditions and testing them under accelerated conditions –
intense sunlight and high temperatures – to track degradation speed of these films. The
challenge is that these experiments can last for weeks to months before conclusions are
clear regarding the synthesis conditions influencing degradation and how to design meaningful future experiments. A potential solution is to train a machine-learning model on past
experiments so we can learn which factors significantly impact film degradation and how
to optimize cell production for longer durability.
